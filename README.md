dia-uml-stm-generation
======================

These are plugins for Dia to generate code from UML state
machine diagrams. Currently 'text' and 'c' generation is
implemented. Adding code generation to other languages
should be trivial.

The plugins are based on code by Unai EstÃ©banez Sevilla.

You need to copy those plugins to ~/.dia/python and will
then be able to generate code via
File->Export->*the respective plugin*
