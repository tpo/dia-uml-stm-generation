dia-uml-stm-generation
======================

These are plugins for [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/)
to generate code from UML state machine diagrams. Currently
'text' and 'c' generation is implemented. Adding code
generation for other languages should be trivial.

The plugins are based on code by Unai EstÃ©banez Sevilla.

You need to copy those plugins to ~/.dia/python and will
then be able to generate code via
File->Export->*the respective plugin*

There's a blog post explaining the code of the plugins
[here](http://sourcepole.ch/2012/6/7/generating-state-machines-with-dia).
